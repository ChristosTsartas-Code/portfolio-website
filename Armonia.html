      <h1>ARMONIA MENTAL HEALTH WEB APP</h1>

      <p class="project_details_description">
        A responsive health and fitness application was developed by conducting a thorough analysis of the problem space
        and performing a competitive analysis. User research was conducted, and user personas, user flows, and user
        journey maps were created to ensure the application met user needs. Finally, a high-fidelity prototype was built
        and testing was conducted to ensure its effectiveness and usability.

                Our mental health application users need a way to address their mental health issues proactively and
                confidentially because they may not feel comfortable reaching out to a professional yet and want to
                explore self-help options first.
                We will know this to be true when we see an increase in the number of users engaging with the self-help
                features of the application and a decrease in the waiting time for appointments with professionals.

      <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p class="project_details_description">In order to better understand the market landscape for mental health apps,
        I conducted a thorough competitive analysis by identifying and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of two key
        competitors.
        Using a SWOT analysis, I gathered information on their products, pricing, marketing strategies, target audience,
        and customer feedback.
        By conducting this analysis, I gained valuable insights into how these competitors are positioning themselves in
        the market and identifying opportunities to differentiate my own mental health app.
        By understanding their strengths and weaknesses, I can develop strategies to capitalize on my own strengths and
        address any potential weaknesses.</p>

      <h2>Research findings</h2>
      <p class="project_details_description">The two platforms, despite their strong market presence, have a few
        limitations:
        The talent pool on these platforms is limited, with a shortage of coaches, trainers, and other experts
        available.
        Expensive premium versions are available.
        The platforms have a strong market presence but have a few limitations.
        Users have trust issues with online platforms when it comes to dealing with mental health issues.</p>

      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
      <p class="project_details_description">To gain insight into user behavior, I conducted interviews with primary
        users, asking open-ended questions and recording notes.
        Subsequently, I analyzed the gathered data and insights, organizing them through the use of affinity mapping.
      </p>

      <h2>User Outcome</h2>
      <p class="project_details_description">A primary concern regarding expert recommendations is the preference for
        personal recommendations over online tools.
        Most users trust experts recommended by a trusted friend.
        Additionally, the price of such services should be reasonable, and the availability of free material should be
        sufficient for users to evaluate the app's value.
        Effective UX design should be simple and self-explanatory.
        Furthermore, such apps should offer course-like material to educate users.
        Users are willing to pay for services if they perceive a need and are comfortable with the app.</p>
